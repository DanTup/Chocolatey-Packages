Dartium is a special build of Chromium that includes the Dart VM. Using Dartium means you don't have to compile your code to JavaScript until you're ready to test on other browsers.

Dart is a cohesive, scalable platform for building apps that run on the web (where you can use Polymer) or on servers (such as with Google Cloud Platform). Use the Dart language, libraries, and tools to write anything from simple scripts to full-featured apps.
